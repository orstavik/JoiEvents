//Problem 1: reasons why re-dispatching events are bad:
//1. timestamp should be at initial dispatch, not event object creation.
//2. properties such as composed and bubbles are really associated with a single dispatch instance.
//3. confusion arise if you use an event as key and then expect properties such as target, path, composedPath() etc to be constant.
//   if somebody uses the event as a key in a map/set, or as an object to dirtycheck against, it is 95% likely that the
//   thing checked is the dispatch instance, and not the event object per se.
//4. preventDefault applies across dispatches.
//5. but stopPropagation is reset for each new dispatch.
//6. the browser can reuse objects to optimize in the background, there are not really any performance benefits to gain here.

//In this system, re-dispatchEvent is disallowed mainly because it cannot function smoothly with defaultActions.
//you cannot both read .preventDefault after the event has completed propagation, And call .preventDefault() *before* the
//event begins propagation, And call .preventDefault() on an event, and then re-dispatchEvent it.

<script>

  //opinion #1: Event objects should not be reused. Override dispatchEvent() to clone all events that has propagated before.
  //            The modern js engines can implement object reuse under the surfasce anyway, and
  //            you would like to leave the dirty checking ability for events open for other forms of optimization.
  //            Re-dispatching event objects is a trap.

  const dispatchEventOG = EventTarget.prototype.dispatchEvent;
   function cloneEvent (e) {
    const clone = new Event(e);
    return Object.assign(clone, e);
  }

  EventTarget.prototype.dispatchEvent = function (e) {
    e = e.eventPhase === Event.ENDED ? cloneEvent(e): e;
    dispatchEventOG.call(this, e);
  }

//todo make a demo that illustrate the problem of redispatching the event:
  // 1.the timestamp being the time of creation, not the time of dispatch,
  // 2. dirty checking possibly giving false responses when the event is dispatched to a different target for example.
  // 3. caching against path using the event object? that wasn't smart.
