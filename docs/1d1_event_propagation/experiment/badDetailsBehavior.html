  //this dispatches a click event which causes an event listener AND a default action to toggle the details element
  //first false, and then true again.
  //The problem here is twofold:
  // 1. The default action will run even though event listeners for the click event that drives the default action also
  //    alters the same state property that the default action will change. This is unexpected. It could be argued
  //    that changing the details open attribute would cause the details.toggle default action of click to be prevented.
  // 2. The state of the details open is the same when the toggle event is dispatched as when the first requestToggle
  //    was made of the details element. you get a toggle event when there is no change in the state of the details element.
