<h1>Why attachShadow() must always set {mode: "open"}.</h1>

<p>
  When you need to find out if a native default action has been triggered inside a closed-mode shadowRoot,
  then if you only intercept the event outside of the closed-mode web component, that information would be lost.
</p>

<script>
  class ClosedComp extends HTMLElement {
    constructor() {
      super();
      const closedRoot = this.attachShadow({mode: "closed"}); //or  = this.attachShadow();
      closedRoot.innerHTML = "<div>a</div><a href='#darkness'>hello</a>";
      this.div = closedRoot.children[0];
      this.a = closedRoot.children[1];
    }
  }

  customElements.define("closed-comp", ClosedComp);

  const closed = document.createElement("closed-comp");
  closed.addEventListener("click", function (e) {
    console.log("Path information: ", e.composedPath());
  });
  //click randomly on either the div or the a element inside the closed shadowRoot
  const randomAOrDiv = [closed.div, closed.a][Math.round(Math.random())];
  randomAOrDiv.click();
  //either way, outside of the closed ShadowRoot, you will always see:
  //Path information: [closed-comp]

  //the problem here is that if you click on the:
  // a) <a> element, then there is a default action added to the click event, but
  // b) <div> element, then there is a no default action added to the click event.
  //
  //If you then reuse the closed-mode web component inside another web component,
  //and you inside this other web component need to add an exclusive default action,
  // then you would need to know if the event target inside the closed-mode web component was the <a> or the <div> element.
  // With closed-mode web components, this information would be lost forever, if you didn't listen for all composed: true
  // events inside the closed-mode shadowRoot *always*.
